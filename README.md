# </> HTMx
HTML Extensions

## Overview

HTMx allows you to issue AJAX requests from HTML without needing to write any javascript.  It is a set of extensions
to HTML (attributes, request headers, etc.) that allow you to use markup for more complex user interfaces and 
features, while at the same time retaining the simplicity of the original web programming model. 

## Background

HTMx is inspired by [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org), but aims to simplify that library and include no dependencies.
