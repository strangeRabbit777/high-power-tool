## Kutty 0.0.1 Release

I'm pleased to announce the [first release](https://unpkg.com/browse/kutty.org@0.0.1/) of kutty, the successor 
to [intercooler.js](http://intercoolerjs.org)!

Like intercooler, kutty brings the power of modern browsers into HTML.


#### What's new/different about kutty vs. intercooler?

* First and foremost, kutty has no external dependencies!  No more dragging jQuery in if you don't want it.
* I've tried to follow conventional naming and behavior standards more closely where applicable (e.g. [`innerHTML`](/attributes/kt-swap) and [`outerHTML`](/attributes/kt-swap))
* Kutty is less kitchen-sink-of-features and more pluggable than intercooler
* Kutty has a better swapping mechanism which introduces a settling step, which allows for nice CSS transitions
  without plain old HTML

Beyond that, basic kutty and intercooler code will look a lot a like:

```html
  <div kt-post="/clicked">Click Me!</div>
```

This will issue an AJAX post to `/clicked`, in a manner familiar to anyone who has used intercooler.

#### What will happen to intercooler?

I'm planning on maintaining both projects.  Intercooler is a slow moving project anyway, and the code is stable and
works fine for people who want to go the jQuery route.  I have a large application written with it and I'm not planning
on moving that to kutty any time soon.

#### How hard will a port to kutty from intercooler be?

Depends a lot on how into the weeds you got with intercooler.  The core attributes are pretty close to one another
but if you were using `ic-action` or event handlers extensively it will be a project.  That's why I chose to rename it,
and to continue to maintain intercooler.
