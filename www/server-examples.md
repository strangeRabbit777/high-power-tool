# htmx Server-Side Examples

There are many examples of integrating htmx with server-side frameworks available on GitHub. Generally speaking,
most server-side frameworks are already pretty well set up to integrate with htmx - after all, most of them were
rendering HTML long before JSON became popular.

Different frameworks and platforms may offer alternative systems for installing htmx - for example, in the Java / JVM
ecosystem, [WebJars](https://www.webjars.org) allows the use of npm packages with popular Java build tools such as 
Maven and Gradle.

These examples may make it a bit easier to get started using htmx with your platform of choice.
