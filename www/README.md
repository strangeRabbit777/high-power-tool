## Running The Website Locally

The htmx.org website is built on [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).  To run the site, run

* `npm install`
* `npx eleventy --serve`

The site should then be available at <http://localhost:8080>

**macOS 64-bit users may need to run `npm rebuild node-sass` to get the documentation site working.**
